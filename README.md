# LanguagesoftheWorld
With this project, I started by doing some web data extraction from Wikipedia on languages that each country from around the world speak. After I imported the data from Wikipedia into excel, I cleaned the data extensively before importing into SQL Server. Once the data was imported, I queried the data to show each countries official language. However, after doing this, I noticed a few things.

Some of the data had some typos and spelling errors

Some countries and languages were missing (French Guinea & Greenland)

After noticing this I went back into the original excel file and added these countries and did some final cleaning touch ups and re-imported the data into SQL Server. After again double checking my work using the same queries, I copied my queries into excel and uploaded those into tableau for visualizations. You can see the visualization here: https://public.tableau.com/views/LanguagesoftheWorld_16465406476760/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
