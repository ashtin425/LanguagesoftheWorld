# LanguagesoftheWorld
With this project, I started by doing some web data extraction from wikipedia on languages that each country from around the world speak. After I imported the data from wikipedia into excel, I cleaned the data extensively before importing into SQL Server. Once the data was imported, I queryied the data to show each countries official language. However after doing this I noticed a few things.
1. Some of the data had some typos and spelling errors
2. Some countries and languages were missing (French Guniea & Greenland)

After noticing this I went back into the orginal excel file and and added these countries and did some final cleaning touch ups and re-imported the data into SQL Server. After again double checking my work using the same queryies, I copied my queries into excel and uploaded those into tableau for visualizations.
